# Explainability 

In this project, we use the LIME and SHAP methods for a better understanding of our model.For complex models, such as deep neural networks,
we cannot use the original model as its own best explanation because it is not easy to understand, so we use a simpler explanation model.

## Dataset
We use [(LifeExpectancy)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) dataset in our project.
